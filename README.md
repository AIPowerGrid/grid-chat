This is a very quick and very dirty hackjob implementation of a standalone web ui for KoboldAIs Horde, which requires no dependencies, installation or setup.

Simply open the file in any browser, and it should work out of the box. All functionality is in a single static HTML file.

You can run it directly from your desktop or throw it on some web server and serve it there too. E.g. Github pages, nginx, whatever.

I do not apologize for my code quality or how I massacred the UI.
