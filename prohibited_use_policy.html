        <h2>Enforcement</h2>

        <p>AI Power Grid reserves the right to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Monitor compliance with this policy</li>
            <li>Investigate potential violations</li>
            <li>Suspend or terminate service to users who violate this policy</li>

        <h2>Privacy Information</h2>

        <p>AI Power Grid operates using a distributed network of worker nodes that process user requests. Please be aware of the following privacy considerations:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Your prompts, inputs, and generated outputs are processed by distributed worker nodes in our network.</li>
            <li>While we implement security practices, the distributed nature of our service means that worker nodes temporarily have access to the content being processed.</li>
            <li>We recommend not including sensitive personal information, confidential data, or private details in your prompts or requests.</li>
            <li>For highly sensitive use cases, consider using dedicated, private AI solutions rather than public distributed services.</li>
            <li>By using our service, you acknowledge and accept that your inputs will be processed by our distributed worker network.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We value your privacy and implement reasonable measures to protect your information, but the inherent architecture of distributed AI processing systems involves multiple processing points. Our worker node operators are expected to maintain appropriate security and privacy practices, but we cannot guarantee end-to-end privacy of all inputs processed through our distributed network.</p>

        <h2>Disclaimer of Liability</h2>

        <p>AI Power Grid is a distributed service that provides access to large language models and image generation models. We do not create or control the content generated by these models in response to user inputs. We make no warranties about the accuracy, reliability, or appropriateness of the output generated by our service.</p>

        <p>While we implement safety measures, our models may occasionally produce inaccurate, offensive, or inappropriate content. Users are responsible for evaluating and taking responsibility for the outputs they receive and how they use those outputs.</p>

        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AI POWER GRID AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICE OR ANY OUTPUTS GENERATED BY OUR SERVICE.</p>
